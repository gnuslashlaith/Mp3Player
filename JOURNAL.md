This is my journal of the design and building process of **Mp3Player**.

## 10/11/2025 5:51 PM - Research !!  

I was looking at the pinout of both the pico and the mp3-tf-16p. Learned some stuff about RX and TX, UART and all of that junk. I realize I don't really know that much!

After that I started planning the prototype. I decided to boiler it down to the very basics: TF-16p, pico, and two buttons. For the pre-prototype at least...

I then mapped the connections from the mp3-tf16p to the pico, like the vcc to vbus, rx to gp3, tx to gp4, etc. 

Findings!!
I am incredibly bad at wiring. I flipped over the tfplayer and connected things to the wrong side. So now its faulty. LOL!

## 10/11/2025 5:55 PM - Getting the TFPlayer to WORK  

SO!!! I got it to work after absolutely frying it last time lolz. 

A few things I noticed:

- I need to pay attention to power. The tfplayer is quite powerful and things can break easier than what im used to.
- code needs to work through some conditional statement to avoid frying. I just left it as like "mp3.play();" in the loop function - yeah LMAO.


Next steps:
- Add buttons! + volume, - volume

## 10/11/2025 5:58 PM - Adding buttons (and failing)  

I'm holding back a little with this project... 

Using buttons without a screen may lead to adding a TON of buttons, do not feel like doing that.

Looking back at the pinout, I could maybe use IO-2 and IO-1; for next song/+ volume, previous song/- volume?
