This is my journal of the design and building process of **Mp3Player**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/414).


## 10/11/2025 5:51 PM - Research !!  

I was looking at the pinout of both the pico and the mp3-tf-16p. Learned some stuff about RX and TX, UART and all of that junk. I realize I don't really know that much!

After that I started planning the prototype. I decided to boiler it down to the very basics: TF-16p, pico, and two buttons. For the pre-prototype at least...

I then mapped the connections from the mp3-tf16p to the pico, like the vcc to vbus, rx to gp3, tx to gp4, etc. 

Findings!!
I am incredibly bad at wiring. I flipped over the tfplayer and connected things to the wrong side. So now its faulty. LOL!

## 10/11/2025 5:55 PM - Getting the TFPlayer to WORK  

SO!!! I got it to work after absolutely frying it last time lolz. 

A few things I noticed:

- I need to pay attention to power. The tfplayer is quite powerful and things can break easier than what im used to.
- code needs to work through some conditional statement to avoid frying. I just left it as like "mp3.play();" in the loop function - yeah LMAO.


Next steps:
- Add buttons! + volume, - volume

## 10/11/2025 5:58 PM - Adding buttons (and failing)  

I'm holding back a little with this project... 

Using buttons without a screen may lead to adding a TON of buttons, do not feel like doing that.

Looking back at the pinout, I could maybe use IO-2 and IO-1; for next song/+ volume, previous song/- volume?

## 10/11/2025 6:02 PM - BUTTON REVELATION!  

Wait a MINUTE! POTENTIOMETERS!! Those EXIST! can you believe it? I could not. 


I could use a potentiometer to control volume, with 1 button that acts as a control around the screen. I just need to figure out how to make it work with the OLED device... 

I drew some diagrams below for how I think it could look like when routing pcb junk

## 10/11/2025 6:04 PM - Debugging and Stuff  

A LOT OF DEBUGGING!! I was trying to set up my oled screen....hehe... why did that take so long. And i see people makin 3d printers up in here - took me like an hour to get a library installed. sighs dramatically.

Potentiometers are quite glitchy/laggy. Maybe the one I got is low quality and susceptible to noise.

## 10/11/2025 6:07 PM - Finally added buttons and stuff  

So I added the next/prev buttons and the potentiometer of course, and like really put it all together. I think I'm ready for PCB Design!! I will say though the wiring is messy and it makes me worried for how it would look like when routing the PCB. I think I'll be ok.

## 10/11/2025 6:11 PM - KICAD SCHEMATIC!  

hehe time for the WORST part. I hate kicad business. But I must for a sleek mp3 player for me to flex in school. theres no way im losing the performative male competition with this thing. 


I dont really understand nets so i really messed it up at first but kind gracious hack clubbers helped me out here. Heh. I fixed them I think lolz.

## 10/11/2025 6:14 PM - Routed the PCB  

i think its done yall... Im unsure if its any good but I did the traces. THey are quite long I realize but hey no errors or warnings, so... a win is a win? Maybe. 

I really dont know if its going to work since like there's kind of no way to test it other than the DRC. i tried different configurations to reduce traces but that caused overlap and more problems. I settled with this.
