## 10/11/2025 - Research !!  

I was looking at the pinout of both the pico and the mp3-tf-16p. Learned some stuff about RX and TX, UART and all of that junk. I realize I don't really know that much!

After that I started planning the prototype. I decided to boiler it down to the very basics: TF-16p, pico, and two buttons. For the pre-prototype at least...

I then mapped the connections from the mp3-tf16p to the pico, like the vcc to vbus, rx to gp3, tx to gp4, etc. 

Findings!!
I am incredibly bad at wiring. I flipped over the tfplayer and connected things to the wrong side. So now its faulty. LOL!
