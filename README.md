# MP3-Player 

Hello I am Laith and this is my mp3player project. It's a handheld device that can carry 128G worth of music so I can listen to my favorite stuff without using Spotify or something. I had so much fun making the demos and stuff
especially with the journalling. To start, I researched about each of the components that I knew I would need: some form of MP3 module, an OLED display, Pi-Pico, a speaker of some sort, and some buttons. Then, I tinkered
with each of the components indvidually. Im pretty familiar with the pi pico so it wasn't so bad, but I used mostly digital connections (buttons, stepper motors and such), but analog/more complex components, like an entire mp3-module, was quite 
new for me. I had to really think about voltage regulation and keeping the components from frying.

I did fry them once, hehe. But that was because it was like 2 AM and i put all the pins on the wrong side.

Also this is the first time I've avoided using any step-by-step video tutorial. It was entirely based on what I knew from the component research (TX/RX connections, UART, analog vs digital pins !!), which made this project feel all the more
rewarding. I still do not have the physical PCB but I did design it and I have the prototype on a breadboard. heheh. Cool stuff!!

I struggled quite a bit with the code since debugging was quite hard, but it was mostly trial and error. Fun!
